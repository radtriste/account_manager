Database
	How to manage the Transaction database ?
		Store a new transaction into a file
		Organize files per folder (per month/year ?)
			year folder -> month
			year files for < year - 2
		Keep a folder summary file
			Hash of all transaction files
				If hash changed, recalculate summary
				If many summary files, recalculate whole folder summary
			Per account
			include budget summary
		Compact old months / years ?
			keep always last 6 months as transaction files, compact the rest per year
			if new file coming, integrate it
		On startup
			Synchronize / Update summaries first
			Load summary files info into memory => lots of I/O ?
		When executing
			If folder change => new calculation and reload in memory ?
